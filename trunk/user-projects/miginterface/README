						The Python MiG Interface Module

INTRODUCTION
The MiG Interface Module contains a set of functions intended for MiG users who want to 
develop grid applications.

The module sits on top of the Minimum intrusion Grid's "miglib.py" 
python module and tries to simplify some of the operations.

REQUIREMENTS
- Python (At least 2.6)
- curl
- A Minimum intrusion Grid user account with a valid 
certificate.
- The miglib.py python module


MOTIVATION
The learning curve of creating a grid application can be steep for
inexperienced developers because they need to learn how to 
perform job and file management on the respective grid middle-ware. By 
building on top of the miglib.py module the Mig interface offers 
simple intuitive functions that require little knowledge of the underlying 
platform.

For instance, the main grid operation is to start a grid job. This 
operation requires writing an mRSL script that is read by the server. It 
contains specifications about the commands to execute on the grid 
resource and input/output files to be used in the job. Also, before the job 
can be submitted, the user must upload the input files to the server. 
Setting up the proper submission environment on the server often takes 
some iterations of trial-and-error.  

The mig interface tries to avoid this by replacing the procedure with a 
single function mig_create_job(), which relieves the user of the details of job 
submission.


EXAMPLES
Example client grid applications using mig interface module can be found 
in the files example1.py and example2.py.  They are intended for learning 
how to use the mig interface module. However, they may also be useful 
as templates for developing grid applications. 


DOCUMENTATION
For documentation please use pydoc to read the function 
descriptions available in the code.
