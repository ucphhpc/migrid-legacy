= Introduction =
The MiG Interface Module contains a set of functions intended for MiG users who want to 
develop grid applications. By grid application is meant a local client script that uses the grid 
as a computational resource by dispatching jobs to the grid server.

The module sits on top of the Minimum intrusion Grid's "miglib.py" 
python module and tries to simplify the operations to make them more
approachable to new users.


= Requirements =
- Python (>=v2.5)
- Curl (remote communcation).
- A Minimum intrusion Grid user account with a valid 
certificate (for authentication).
- The miglib.py python module (base MiG operations).


= Motivation = 
The learning curve of creating a grid application can be steep for
inexperienced grid developers because they need to learn how to 
perform job and file management on the respective grid middle-ware. By 
building on top of the miglib.py module the Mig interface offers 
simple and intuitive functions that require little knowledge of the underlying 
platform.

For instance, the main grid operation, to start a grid job. This 
operation requires a series of steps. These include oploading input 
files for the job, configuring a job specification file (.mRSL-script) and 
then submitting the job. Setting up the proper submission environment 
on the server often take some iterations of trial-and-error. 

The mig interface tries to avoid this by replacing the procedure with a 
single function mig_create_job(), which relieves the user from the 
details of job submission.


= Getting Started =
Before you start using the MiG Interface Module, miginterface.py, make sure you 
have the miglib.py API properly installed. If you installed the MiG user scripts you 
can also test by running the list directory script, migls.py. Second, 
link or copy miglib.py into the miginterface directory. Finally, to verify that the MiG Interface 
Module works, run the examples mentioned below in the EXAMPLES section. 


= Examples =
Example client grid applications using mig interface module can be found 
in the files example1.py and example2.py in the same folder as the 
module file. They are intended for learning how to use the mig 
interface module. However, they may also be useful as templates for 
developing grid applications.

To run an example file:
	python example1.py


= Documentation = 
For documentation please use pydoc to read the function 
descriptions available in the code.
