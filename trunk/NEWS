= Introduction =
This file contains sporadic news entries and changelog entries for the
individual releases of the MiG project code.


== News ==
A short description of changes 

=== May 1st, 2009 ===
We finally got the old grey web pages completely overhauled. Thanks to those of you 
that contributed to this often overlooked area.
Updated setup helpers to make custom install locations easier.


=== March 17, 2009 ===
Added this file for easier tracking of changes. Another bugfixing
release (1.0.2), so we recommend that everyone upgrades to this version.


=== March 06, 2009 ===
After a long time in planning we finally released the project under the
GPL v2 today. The project started all the way back in 2003, so there's
already quite a bit of code and the setup is not trivial. Over the
coming months we will improve the code and instructions to ease setup
for other users.
