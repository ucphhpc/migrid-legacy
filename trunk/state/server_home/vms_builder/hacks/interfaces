# This file is a hack due to a glitch when deploying virtual
# machines to resources. VirtualBox presents new hardware identifiers
# and linux responds by renaming the interface name from eth0 to eth1
# resulting in a missing configuration for the eth1 and thus no
# network for the appliance.
#
# An alternative is to use a command like:
# dhclient `dmesg | grep "renamed network interface eth.*eth.*" | grep -o "to eth.*" | cut -b 4-`
# this would be an attempt to dynamicly assign a dhcp lease to whichever
# the device is renamed to.
# That would however but a limited attempt to fix the dynamic renaming
# and much more work would be done to make it stable.
# This static approach is ugly but stable.
