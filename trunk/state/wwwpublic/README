This directory is for public files on migrid sites and all files are visible in
the root on the plain HTTP virtual host and through /public/ on the HTTPS
virtual hosts.

For UI V3 support in About, Support and Status popups on user pages it is
necessary to add about-snippet.html, faq-snippet.html and
quickstart-snippet.html files or symlinks to the sample site files with a
similar prefix.

The monitor, archives and public vgrid files should automatically be included here.
