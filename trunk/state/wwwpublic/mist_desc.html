<p>
Multi-purpose Infrastructure Service Tools (MIST) provides as set of
cloud compute nodes for intermediate computation requiring a flexible
software environment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="warningtext">
We're currently running MIST in beta-testing for a limited set of experienced
users only. Please get in touch if you want to join in the testing.</span><br/>
<br/>
The spawned instances are persistent, meaning that any change made
during a session is preserved even if the server is terminated.<br/> 
Instances are not time limited and can be resumed from any client.<br/>
<!--

instances and our future roadmap for allowing customization, check out
