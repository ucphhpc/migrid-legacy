Multi-purpose Infrastructure Service Tools (MIST) provides as set of
cloud compute nodes for intermediate computation requiring a flexible
software environment.<br/>

Instances are not time limited and can be resumed from another browser
session.<br/> <br/>

The spawned instances are persistent, meaning that any change made
during a session is preserved even if the server is terminated.<br/> 

For more information about how you can ease the task of configuring your
instances and our future roadmap for allowing customization, check out
the FAQ section "How do I install and run software XYZ in Cloud nodes?"
