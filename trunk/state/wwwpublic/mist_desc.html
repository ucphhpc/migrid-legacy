Multi-purpose Infrastructure Service Tools (MIST) provides as set of
cloud compute nodes for intermediate computation requiring a flexible
software environment.<br/><br/>

<span class="warningtext">
We're currently running MIST in initial beta testing and with access
only for a limited set of users already experienced with remote Linux
system management over SSH. Please get in touch if you fit in that
category and would like to join in the testing.</span><br/>
<br/>

Instances are not time limited and can be resumed from any client. The
spawned instances are persistent, meaning that any change made during a
session is preserved even if the server is terminated.<br/>
