<p>
Data Analysis Gateway or DAG provides a set of interactive data
analysis nodes for intermediate computation, which can be completed in a
short timeframe.<br/> 
This means that any spawned instance is limited to 2 hours of inactivity
before it will be terminated.<br/> <br/> 

The spawned instances are non-persistent, meaning that any change made
during a session is lost once the server is terminated.<br/> 
The only exception to this is the data that is saved in the provided
mount directory (i.e. ~/work)<br/> <br/>  

For more information about how you can ease the task of configuring your
instances and our future roadmap for allowing customization, check out
