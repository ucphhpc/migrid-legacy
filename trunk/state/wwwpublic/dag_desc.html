<p>Data Access Gateway or DAG provides as set of compute nodes for intermediate computation that can be completed in a short timeframe. <br>
This means that any spawned instance is limited to 2 hours of inactivity before it will be terminated.<br> <br>

The spawned instances are non-persistent, meaning that any change made during a session is lost once the server is terminated. <br>
The only exception to this is the data that is saved in the provided mount directory (i.e. ~/work) <br> <br> 

For more information about how you can ease the task of configuring your instances and our future roadmap for allowing customization, check out the FAQ section "How do I install and run software XYZ in Jupyter?" at <a href="http://www.erda.dk">ERDA FAQ</a></p>
