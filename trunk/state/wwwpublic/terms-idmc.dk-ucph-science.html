<h1>IDMC Terms of Use</h1>
<h2>Terms</h2>
<p>
These terms of service (the "Terms") govern your access to and use of
IDMC ("we" or "our") websites and services (the "Services"), so
please carefully read them before using the Services.
</p>
<p>
By using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are
using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to
these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the
authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case, "you"
and "your" will refer to that organization.
</p>
<p>
You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms. You may
use the Services only if you have the power to form a contract with
IDMC and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. The
Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more
features. We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time
without prior notice to you. We may also remove any content from our
Services at our discretion.
</p>

<h2>Your Privacy</h2>
<p>
By using our Services you provide us with information, files, and
folders that you submit to IDMC (together, "your stuff"). You retain
full ownership to your stuff. We don't claim any ownership to any of
it. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your stuff or intellectual
property except for the limited rights that are needed to run the
Services, as explained below.
</p>
<p>
We may need your permission to do things you ask us to do with your
stuff, for example, hosting your files, or sharing them at your
direction. This includes product features visible to you, for example
document previews. It also includes design choices we make to
technically administer our Services, for example, how we redundantly
backup data to keep it safe. You give us the permissions we need to do
those things solely to provide the Services. This permission also
extends to any trusted third parties at UCPH we work with to provide the Services,
for example University IT, which provides our UCPH OpenID login (again, only to
provide the Services).
</p>
<p>
We won't disclose to parties outside IDMC files stored in your
IDMC account and information about you that we collect except we
have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a)
comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect
the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c)
prevent fraud or abuse of IDMC or its users; or (d) to protect
IDMC's property rights.
</p>
<p>
You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your files
and folders, and your communications with others while using the
Services. For example, it's your responsibility to ensure that you have
the rights or permission needed to comply with these Terms.
</p>
<p>
We may choose to review public content for compliance with our community
guidelines, but you acknowledge that IDMC has no obligation to
monitor any information on the Services. We are not responsible for the
accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or legality of files, user
posts, or any other information you may be able to access using the
Services.
</p>

<h2>Sharing Your Stuff</h2>
<p>
The Services provide features that allow you to share your stuff with
others or to make it public. There are many things that users may do
with that stuff (for example, copy it, modify it, re-share it). Please
consider carefully what you choose to share or make public. IDMC has
no responsibility for that activity.
</p>

<h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
<p>
Files and other content in the Services may be protected by intellectual
property rights of others. Please do not copy, upload, download, or
share files unless you have the right to do so. You, not IDMC, will
be fully responsible and liable for what you copy, share, upload,
download or otherwise use while using the Services. You must not upload
spyware or any other malicious software to the Service.
</p>
<p>
You, and not IDMC, are responsible for maintaining and protecting
all of your stuff. IDMC will not be liable for any loss or
corruption of your stuff, or for any costs or expenses associated with
backing up or restoring any of your stuff.
</p>

<h2>Account Security</h2>
<p>
You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access
the Services and you agree not to disclose your password to any third
party. You are responsible for any activity using your account, whether
or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify
IDMC of any unauthorized use of your account. You acknowledge that
if you wish to protect your transmission of data or files to IDMC,
it is your responsibility to use a secure encrypted connection to
communicate with the Services.
</p>

<h2>IDMC is Available "AS-IS"</h2>
<p>
Though we want to provide a great service, there are certain things
about the service we can't promise. For example, THE SERVICES AND
SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", AT YOUR OWN RISK, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGEMENT. IDMC will have no responsibility for any harm to
your computer system, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that
results from your access to or use of the Services or Software. Some
states do not allow the types of disclaimers in this paragraph, so they
may not apply to you.
</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL IDMC, ITS
AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE
LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR
CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS)
DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT IDMC HAS BEEN
WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF
ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING
TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU
TO IDMC FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION.
</p>

<h2>Modifications</h2>
<p>
We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version
will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our sole
discretion, is material we will notify you (for example via email to the
email address associated with your account). Other changes may be posted
to the terms page, so please check those pages regularly. By continuing
to access or use the Services after revisions become effective, you
agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new
terms, please stop using the Services.
