= Interactive jobs =
It is possible to support interactive MiG jobs using a web based java vnc client.
Please place vncviewer.jar in this directory to allow that kind of jobs.
If running on a Debian server yiu can pull in the java-vnc package and copy or link 
the included vncviewer.jar from there.
