= Using the sandbox generator =
The sandbox generator requires a hard disk image for each of the supported disk sizes.
At the momemt the 100MB, 1G and 2G sizes map to hda_{100,1000,2000}.img files.
The images must be modified on-the-fly when a sandbox is created so you
need to provide user level mounting for a particular file, hda.img which
will be used for these modify mounts. In other words you need to add the
following line to your /etc/fstab in order to allow sandbox generation:
/home/mig/state/sss_home/MiG-SSS/hda.img /home/mig/state/sss_home/mnt  auto    user,loop      0       0

..if using the default user and path settings.

This will allow the mig user to mount the hda.img on the mnt dir without
additional privileges.
After adding that line you can proceed to make the images that aren't
included due to size restrictions. They should preferably be created as
sparse qemu images with:
qemu-img create hda.img 2G
mkfs.ext2 -F hda.img
tune2fs -c 100 -i 365 hda.img
mount mnt
tar xvzf mig-hda.tgz -C mnt
umount mnt
mv hda.img hda_2000.img

Please note that you may have to mount and unmount using sudo if the
corresponding mount points aren't included in /etc/fstab
On the development servers they should automatically be added during
account creation.

As qemu-img output then shows they only take up a small fraction of the denominal size:
0|~/sss_home/MiG-SSS > ll hda_2000.img                                                         mig@mig-1
-rw-r--r-- 1 mig mig 2147483648 Mar 11 13:14 hda_2000.img
0|~/sss_home/MiG-SSS > qemu-img info hda_2000.img                                              mig@mig-1
image: hda_2000.img
file format: raw
virtual size: 2.0G (2147483648 bytes)
disk size: 920K

In the sandbox generator they are converted to qcow images on the fly.
We would prefer to only have them on qcow format but we need raw format to be able
to mount and modify the image on the fly, so we do that with the raw images and
convert them just before zip and download.

The generator needs a MiG.iso base file system iso which can be downloaded from:
http://mig-1.imada.sdu.dk/public/sandbox/MiG-SSS/MiG.iso

Windows sandboxes additionally need a couple of installers avilable from:
