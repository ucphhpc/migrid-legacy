= Using the sandbox generator =
The sandbox generator requires a hard disk image for each of the supported disk sizes.
At the momemt the 100MB, 1G and 2G sizes map to hda_{100,1000,2000}.img files.
Those files should preferably be created as sparse qemu images with:
qemu-img create hda_2000.img 2G
mkfs.ext2 hda_2000.img
tune2fs -c 100 -i 365 hda_2000.img
mount -o loop -t ext2 hda_2000.img disk
tar xvzf mig-hda.tgz -C disk
umount disk

As qemu-img output then shows they only take up a small fraction of the denominal size:
0|~/sss_home/MiG-SSS > ll hda_2000.img                                                         mig@mig-1
-rw-r--r-- 1 mig mig 2147483648 Mar 11 13:14 hda_2000.img
0|~/sss_home/MiG-SSS > qemu-img info hda_2000.img                                              mig@mig-1
image: hda_2000.img
file format: raw
virtual size: 2.0G (2147483648 bytes)
disk size: 920K

In the sandbox generator they are converted to qcow images on the fly.
We would prefer to only have them on qcow format but we need raw format to be able
to mount and modify the image on the fly, so we do that with the raw images and
convert them just before zip and download.

The generator needs a MiG.iso base file system iso which can be downloaded from:
http://mig-1.imada.sdu.dk/public/sandbox/MiG-SSS/MiG.iso

Windows sandboxes additionally need a couple of installers avilable from:
