This folder contains a PAM module for login that uses the MiG password files, rather than the system shadow files.

The module is intended to be used with libnss_mig in the nsswitch setup, such that the users home folder can contain the special MiG password files.

The MiG password files are encrypted with standard PKBDF2-SHA256 hashing.

The C implementation of pkbdf2 is taken from:
https://github.com/kholia/PKCS5_PBKDF2/

If you need to update the implementation, make sure you patch it by prefixing the sha2_* functions with the "static" keyword, so they are not exported and mess with OpenSSH.

The C implementation of b64 is taken from:
https://github.com/Comcast/trower-base64/

The pam_mig module implements the full PAM stack and can thus be used exclusively.

An example PAM config file for SSH should be placed in /etc/pam.d/sshd and could look like:

#Un-comment this line if you want regular system users to log in with passwords as well (pubkeys are handled without PAM):
#@include common-auth

account  required /lib/libpam_mig.so
auth     required /lib/libpam_mig.so
password required /lib/libpam_mig.so
session  required /lib/libpam_mig.so


To support public key authentication with MiG, you need to add a section to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file that matches the MiG group and redirects to their public keys, while also chrooting them:

Match Group mig
  AuthorizedKeysFile	%h/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ChrootDirectory		%h
  ForceCommand internal-sftp


NOTE: On 64 bit systems, the Makefile installs libraries in /lib, but they should be installed in /lib64
