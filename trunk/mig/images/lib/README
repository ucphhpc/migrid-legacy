= The lib directory =
This is a web exposed directory for core web UI dependencies that are 
unsuitable for direct inclusion in ../js and ../css . It is exposed under
/images/lib/ on the web server.

CodeMirror (http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/) is a pure javascript 
editor overlay with support for highlighting syntax in e.g. html textareas. 
We use it in several areas on the Settings page and thus need it in the core 
installation. It uses multiple files (with some common names) for parsing and
formatting, so it does not fit well into the general js and css dirs.

Other dependencies for either core or widget-deps can be stored here as well.
