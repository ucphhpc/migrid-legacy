= MiG web page style =
The site.css file is used by all MiG web pages, so site wide style can easily be modified by simply 
changing the symlink to another css file.

This is in addition to the user selectable styles and any future custom skin support.

Please note that the file or symlink site-logo.png is used as the top logo on all pages.
Similarly the status-icons dir or symlink holds e.g. the resource monitor icons.
