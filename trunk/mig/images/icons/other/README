trashcan icons are from the Matte icon pack:
http://findicons.com/pack/2226/matte_basic
only downscaled to 16x16 and renamed for clarity.

folder-*-blue.png are manually color-balanced versions of the corresponding
famfamfam ones.
They were made by openin in gimp, selection all folder pixels using color
match and then using Colors -> Color Balance and setting these values for 
each of the Shadows, Midtones and Highlights ranges:
Cyan	<->	Red	 -40
Magenta	<->	Green 	 0
Yellow	<->	Blue	 100
