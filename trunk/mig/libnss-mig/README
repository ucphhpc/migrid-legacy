This folder contains a Name Server module for providing MiG users as virtual users in a system.

To install the module, run `sudo make install`, which will build the binary and copy it into /lib, such that it can be used by nsswitch.

The module needs to be registered in the nsswitch.conf file, and a special file needs to be created in:
/etc/libnss_mig.conf

This file should contain exactly one line with an entry in the passwd
format, describing the MiG system user that all MiG users are mapped
to. Example for RestrictFS:

mig:x:501:501:MIG User:/restrictfs:/bin/bash

This sets up all MiG virtual users to have UID and GID 501.

For OpenSSH with an external subsystem it is strictly required that shell
is set to /bin/bash or similar, while restrictfs can use /bin/false or
/sbin/nologin for added security. 
With the subsystem the home folder should be set to the MiG user_home
folder, usually found in the state folder. 
If restrictfs is used, it should be set to the restrictfs mount point,
usually /restrictfs.

In any case home folder is then suffixed with the username and expanded
to provide an absolute path. 

The OpenSSH setup using the paramiko handler from grid_sftp as subsystem
would need a line something like this example with UID/GID 1001: 

mig:x:1001:1001:MIG User:/home/mig/state/user_home:/bin/bash

The entry in /etc/nsswitch.conf looks like this before updating:
passwd:         compat
group:          compat
shadow:         compat
gshadow:        files

It could could look like this after updating:

passwd:         compat mig
group:          compat
shadow:         compat mig
gshadow:        files



NOTE: The install location depends on architecture and distro but the
Makefile attempts to autodetect the proper location.
You can always call 'make install' with a custom libdir if it does
not fit any of the default /path/to/libnss_X.so ones auto-detected:
libdir=/path/to/libnss_X.so make -e install
