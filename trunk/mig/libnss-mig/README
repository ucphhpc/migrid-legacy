This folder contains a Name Server module for providing MiG users as virtual users in a system.

To install the module, run `sudo make install`, which will build the binary and copy it into /lib, such that it can be used by nsswitch.

The module needs to be registered in the nsswitch.conf file, and a special file needs to be created in:
/etc/libss_mig.conf

This file should contain exactly one line with an entry in the passwd format, describing the MiG system user that all MiG users are mapped to. Example:

mig:x:501:501:MIG User:/restrictfs:/bin/bash

This sets up all MiG virtual users to have UID and GID 501.

The home folder should be set to the MiG user_home folder, usually found in the state folder.
If restrictfs is used, it should be set to the restrictfs mount point, usually /restrictfs.

The home folder is then suffixed with the username and expanded to provide an absolute path.


The entry in /etc/nsswitch.conf looks like this before updating:
passwd:         compat
group:          compat
shadow:         compat
gshadow:        files

It could could look like this after updating:

passwd:         compat mig
group:          compat
shadow:         compat mig
gshadow:        files



NOTE: On 64 bit systems, the Makefile installs libraries in /lib, but they should be installed in /lib64
