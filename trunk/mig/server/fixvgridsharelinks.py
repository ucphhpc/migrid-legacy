"""Fix any missing sharelinks on adminvgrid pages by going through all
sharelinks and making sure that all those pointing inside a vgrid share on
modern format are actually included in the vgrid sharelink pickle used to
render the list of sharelinks on the vgrid admin page.
In short some of these sharelinks may not have been caught as vgrid sharelinks
due to the bug fixed in rev4168+4169. Namely the detection of vgrid shares was
not correctly updated after the switch from the legacy vgrid_files_home to
the new vgrid_files_writable and vgrid_files_readonly so the vgrid sharelink
pickle didn't get updated for recent vgrids.
