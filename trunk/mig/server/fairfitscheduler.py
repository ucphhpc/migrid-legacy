    potential problem with jobs being starved due to bad fitness.

    # fit and to counter starvation in general. A bonus based on the ratio
    # between queued and job wallclock time is additionally included to
    # slightly favor shorter jobs more over time.

    # 0.01 means that any job waiting 30000 seconds (approx 8 hours) will
    # always be in front of even a perfectly fitting job submitted just now.
    # Due to the added relative wait time ratio bonus the jobs requesting
    # shorter time will reach that tipping point a bit sooner.
