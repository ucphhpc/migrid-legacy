        Find the jobs that can be run on the resource and select
        the shortest one unless concurrent jobs can be found that
        allow higher throughput.
        Scheduling history will probably be necessary to detect
        the latter.

        Please note that this may end up as a multidimensional
        version of the 0-1 knapsack problem. Furthermore we may
        run into trouble since we can only schedule on job at a
        time and the next slot may very well be different: we
        need info about past and future timeslots!

        For now we always select the shortest job in the hope that
        it will reduce the time before we get a new timeslot.
        
        All jobs are filtered against must_match first so that only
        jobs that match all attribute values there are considered
        for scheduling.
