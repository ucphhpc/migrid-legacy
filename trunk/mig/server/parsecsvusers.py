"""Read a csv-format list of users and output a corresponding list of
distinguished name entries for direct use in the importusers script.
The csv file must use semi-colon as a separator and include a special header
line to define the format of the remaining user lines using a subset of the
MiG user database ID field names. As an example the csv file could contain:
### full_name;email;organization;country
Jonas Bardino;bardino@nbi.ku.dk;NBI;DK

and this script would then generate the user ID list:
/C=DK/ST=NA/L=NA/O=NBI/OU=NA/CN=Jonas Bardino/emailAddress=bardino@nbi.ku.dk
which could be used with importusers.py to create that user with a random
password.

Use e.g. as in
./parsecsvusers.py participants.csv > import-participants.list
then import with something like
./importusers.py [OPTIONS] import-participants.list
where OPTIONS might include things like generate password, automatic account
expire time and workgroup membership.
Afterwards one would then typically use notifymigoid and notifypassword to
inform imported users about their login.
