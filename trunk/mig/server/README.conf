= MiG server configuration =
As a default, the MiGserver.conf file or symlink in this directory is used by
all MiG server components and can be auto generated along with apache 
configurations, using the generateconfs.py script in mig/install .
If you want to put MiGserver.conf in a different directory, you can define
the environment variable MIG_CONF to contain the full absolute path to it.
It is also possible to manually create the conf files, but please make sure
that your settings match your apache configurations then to avoid e.g. access
problems.

When you have created a configuration and saved it in this directory you
can verify it with the checkconf.py script.
It will complain if required options are missing and offer to help you
create any paths which you configured that do not yet exist.
If you use the helper you should be careful to create the X_stdin paths
as named pipes.
