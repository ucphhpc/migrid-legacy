# NOTE: if you run the Paramiko-based SFTP service you may also want to patch
# Paramiko with something like the
# silence-scan-noise_python-paramiko-2.1.1-9.el7_transport.py.diff patch in the
# mig/src/paramiko/ folder to avoid the below search on sftp.log spewing a ton
# of traceback errors from automated ssh scanners.

# IMPORTANT: if placed in /etc/cron.X the script filename must be 
# something consisting entirely of upper and lower case letters, digits, 
# underscores, and hyphens. I.e. if the script name contains e.g. a period, 
# '.', it will be silently ignored! 
# This is a limitation on the run-parts wrapper used by cron 
# (see man run-parts for the rationale behind this).
