= Deb packages for Ubuntu and Debian =
We distribute deb packages with the latest MiG user scripts to make life
easier for users.

The packages should be *locally* built but signed with the official MiG
software signing key from mig@dk-cert.migrid.org:.gnupg/ .
The corresponding passphrase is included in the MiG-developers VGrid owners SCM.
Please note that we generated a new 4096 bit RSA key in 2018 because the old
1024 bit one was no longer deemed strong enough by current APT installations.
Thus any old references to the mig@www.migrid.org should be replaced by
the new key ID mig@migrid.org.

Signing is achieved by mounting the mig user home on the build host during build:
[prepare ssh login as mig at dk-cert.migrid.org]
mkdir -p  ~/mnt/mig@dk-cert.migrid.org
sshfs mig@dk-cert.migrid.org: ~/mnt/mig@dk-cert.migrid.org  -o uid=$(id -u) -o gid=$(id -g)
[add deb-src https://dk-sid.migrid.org/public/deb stable main to your APT sources]
sudo apt-get update
mkdir -p  ~/build
cd ~/build
apt-get source mig-user-scripts
cd mig-user-scripts-VERSION
EMAIL="Minimum intrusion Grid <mig@migrid.org>" dch -i
[edit changelog and save - possibly cd to new dir if it mentions rename]
[make your changes]
GNUPGHOME=~/mnt/mig@dk-cert.migrid.org/.gnupg dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
[copy package files to ~/mnt/mig@dk-cert.migrid.org/state/wwwpublic/deb/pool/main/]

Finally login as mig on dk.migrid.org and run the updaterep.sh script from
~mig/state/wwwpublic/deb/ .

On clients add the package repo line
deb https://dk-sid.migrid.org/public/deb stable main
to your APT sources.
