This is where we store raw cvs checkouts for use by "anonymous" developers.

The restricted versions that these developers have access to are stored in
~mig/public/. 
The create_anonymous_checkout.sh script is used to maintain both
the raw checkouts and the restricted versions.  
If run without arguments the script will create or update the HEAD revision of
the mig module in ./mig and create a restricted version in ~/mig/public/mig.
If a tag name is passed to the script it will instead create or update that
revision of mig in ./mig-TAG and create a restricted version of that tag in
~mig/public/mig-TAG.

Thus to create a restricted version of the latest version of mig run:
create_anonymous_checkout.sh

To create a restricted version of mig in the version tagged 'MiG-0_0_4' run:
create_anonymous_checkout.sh MiG-0_0_4

It may be necessary to change the user in ~mig/.ssh/config to actually access
the cvs repository.

Please check that none of the files listed in the script output are too sensible to include in the restricted version.
