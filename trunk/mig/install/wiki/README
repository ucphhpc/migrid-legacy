= VGrid Wikis =
The optional VGrid Wiki component is provided by MoinMoin.
If you install the default Debian moinmoin-common package you may want to edit
the wikiconfig file used for all such future Wikis.
This directory includes a diff between the packaged version in 
/usr/share/moin/config/wikiconfig.py
and a version usable with MiG.
Please manually apply the relevant changes to your local copy of wikiconfig.py
used for MiG (path as configured by moin_share in the SITE section of your
MiGserver.conf). You will likely want to at least use other email settings to
fit your particular server.
The changes from /moin_static171 to /wiki in a couple of locations is necessary
to fit the apache configuration no matter what version of MoinMoin is used.
The other changes cover default page and mail support setup.
