This directory contains SLURM helper scripts that can be 'installed' at
the SLURM resources in order to simplify the commands used in the LRMSX
fields of the resource configuration.
They should preferably be copied to and used from a read-only location
on the resource, because they should be auto executed as a part of
{leader,master}_node_script.

Please note that the scripts implicitly expects the MiG exe-unit to be
called the same as the SLURM queue to use. That is, if your slurm queue
is called 'medium' you should also make an exe unit called 'medium' on
the MiG resource.
