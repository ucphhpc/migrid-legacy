This directory contains SLURM helper scripts that can be 'installed' at the SLURM
resources in order to simplify the commands used in the LRMSX fields of the
resource configuration.
They should preferably be copied to and used from a read-only location on the
resource, because they should be auto executed as a part of
{leader,master}_node_script.
