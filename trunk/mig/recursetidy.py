"""Clean up an entire tree or archive of python code using PythonTidy from
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonTidy/
Just save the latest version of PythonTidy in ./PythonTidy.py or in your
PYTHONPATH before running this program.
The program tries hard to guess if you want to process a plain file/directory
or an archive and if you want the tidied file(s) in a archive or directory.

Usage:
python recursetidy.py [SOURCE] [DESTINATION] [FILEPATTERN]
SOURCE is a plain python file, a directory structure with some python
files in it, or a zip/tar archive with optional gzip or bzip2 compression.
DESTINATION likewise is one of the previously mentioned archive types or an
existing directory.
The default SOURCE is code.zip and the default DESTINATION is tidied.zip but
just supply arguments to override those.
FILEPATTERN is a UNIX style wildcard pattern of filenames to tidy. The default
'*.py' matches all files with a '.py' extension. Please note that you will
likely need to escape or quote this argument if you want to change it.
