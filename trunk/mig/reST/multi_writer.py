# Setup a restructured text example
reST = """
Example of reST:
================

This is a small example of the way reST can be used as a base
for generating HTML formatted text that:

- looks nice
- is standards compliant
- is flexible

We *may* decide to start using this as text formatting tool in
MiG__ later on.

We can also use it for creating tables if we want to:

=====  =====  ======
Input         Output
------------  ------
A      B      A or B
=====  =====  ======
False  False  False
True   False  True
False  True   True
True   True   True
=====  =====  ======

Have fun!
