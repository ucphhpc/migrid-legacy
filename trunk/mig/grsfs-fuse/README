= Grid Replicated Storage for MiG =
This directory contains the Grid Replicated Storage (GRSfs) code developed by
Jan Wiberg in his thesis. It is intended for phasing into the MiG failover
server configuration, but that part is still work in progress.
Do not use it in production just yet!


== System Requirements ==
GRSfs requires python (>=2.6) and python bindings for FUSE, python-fuse
(>=0.2). This imposes additional python requirements in relation to the MiG
server software, but this component will likely remain experimental
until common Linux distributions have completely moved to python-2.6 or
above anyway.


== Further Information ==
Jan's thesis is included as a PDF in mig/public-doc/ for background
information.
