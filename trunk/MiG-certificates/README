This dir holds (links to) the MiG SSL keys and certificates for grid_X 
daemons (combined.{pem,pub}), apache (server.{key,crt}, cacert.pem, crl-pem in
in vhost FQDN-subdirs) and the optional dist-server intercomm
({MiGserver{key,cert}.pem)

Please note that combined.pem used by the grid_X daemons is the concatenation
of the unarmored key and certificate for the SID host apache certs:
cat server.{key,crt} > combined.pem
chown mig:mig combined.pem
Similarly the matching combined.pub used along with combined.pem only in the
sftp server is extracted with:
ssh-keygen -y -f combined.pem > combined.pub

All keys should be kept protected with restrictive permissions:
chown 0:0 *.key server.pem ca.pem
chmod 400 *.key server.pem ca.pem combined.pem

Do not change keys unecessarily since it makes sftp clients fail with 
possible MITM warning. It is even worse for sshfs which just fails with a
vague error in that case. 
This leaves us in a bit of a mess with the one-year startssl keys/certs. If 
at all possible request the renewed certificate with the existing key to make 
the key part and thus also the ssh host pub key remain unchanged.
